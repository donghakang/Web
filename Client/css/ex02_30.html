      When Alice follows the White Rabbit down a rabbit hole, she finds herself
      in a land where she can change her size. She meets a Duchess with a pig
      for a baby, a Cook that throws spoons, a wise but mad Cheshire cat, the
      March Hare, Mad Hatter and a Dormouse. A Caterpillar shows her how to
      adjust her height by eating from the right and left sides of a mushroom.
      With that knowledge,
